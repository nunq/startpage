# startpage

my /comfy/ startpage

> links are personalized, you probably want to change them

* the page needs js for basic functionality, the noscript version is
  barely functional
  
* geolocation is used to get current weather conditions (openweathermap api)

* the image is refreshed every minute, the weather every 10 minutes

* how the search bar works:
```
if :// -> redirect
if url but no :// -> prefix https:// and redirect
else forward query to duckduckgo
```

* browser compatibility may vary (uses avif images, ogg)
* doesn't work at all on mobile and probably will never
